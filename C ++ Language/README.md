# C++ Language Projects 
## Description 
This section includes projects and exercises designed to demonstrate my proficiency in C++. These projects focus on core concepts like object-oriented programming, memory management, and algorithm implementation. 

## Projects 
1. **[Bottomup]**: This project demonstrates a bottom-up approach to solving an upside down image.
   **[Credit]**: This project implements a C++ program that validates credit card numbers using Luhnâ€™s algorithm.
   **[Filter-less]**: This project involves applying image processing filters to bitmap images using C++.
   **[Inheritance]**: This project demonstrates the use of inheritance in C++, a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming.
   **[Mario-less]**: This project recreates a simplified version of the Mario game pyramid challenge using C++.
   **[Plurality]**: This project implements a plurality voting system in C++.
   **[Readability]**: This project calculates the readability level of a given text using C++.
   **[Recover]**: This project demonstrates how to recover deleted image files from a memory card using C++.
   **[Runoff]**: This project implements a runoff voting system in C++.
   **[Speller]**: This project implements a runoff voting system in C++.
      - It loads a dictionary file into memory, checks the spelling of words in a text file, and reports any misspellings.
      - This project demonstrates efficient data structures (e.g., hash tables or tries) and focuses on memory management and file I/O operations.
   **[Substituion]**: This project implements a substitution cipher in C++..
      -It encrypts plaintext by substituting each letter with a corresponding character based on a user-provided key.
      -The project demonstrates string manipulation, input validation, and basic cryptographic principles.


## Technologies Used 
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio).

## Future Additions 
- Advanced projects using STL, multithreading, etc.
