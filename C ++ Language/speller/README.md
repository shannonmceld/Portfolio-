# Speller: A Spell-Checker in C++  



## Description  

This project implements a spell-checker in C++. It loads a dictionary file into memory, checks the spelling of words in a text file, and reports any misspellings. This project demonstrates efficient data structures (e.g., hash tables or tries) and focuses on memory management and file I/O operations.  



## Features  

- Loads a custom dictionary for word validation.  

- Processes input text files to identify misspelled words.  

- Tracks performance metrics like runtime and memory usage.  



## Technologies Used  

- C++  



## How to Run  

1. Compile the code:  

   ```bash  

   g++ -o speller speller.cpp  



2. Run the program with a dictionary and text file:



./speller dictionary.txt text.txt  







Future Improvements



• Support for multiple dictionary formats.

• Add suggestions for misspelled words.
