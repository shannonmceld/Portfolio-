# Mario-Less  



## Description  

This project recreates a simplified version of the Mario game pyramid challenge using C++. The program prompts the user to input a height and builds a pyramid of hash symbols (`#`) with the specified height, demonstrating logic, loops, and user input handling in C++.  



## Features  

- Dynamic pyramid generation based on user input.  

- Simple and interactive terminal-based program.  



## Technologies Used  

- C++  



## How to Run  

1. Compile the code:  

   ```bash  

   g++ -o mario-less mario-less.cpp  



2. Run the program:



./mario-less  







Future Improvements



• Add advanced patterns or variations to the pyramid.

• Integrate colorized output for enhanced visuals.
