# Recover Deleted Files  



## Description  

This project demonstrates how to recover deleted image files from a memory card using C++. It scans raw binary data for JPEG file signatures and reconstructs the files. This project showcases file I/O, pattern matching, and data recovery techniques.  



## Features  

- Scans memory card files for JPEG headers.  

- Recovers and reconstructs deleted images.  

- Outputs recovered images to separate files.  



## Technologies Used  

- C++  



## How to Run  

1. Compile the code:  

   ```bash  

   g++ -o recover recover.cpp  



2. Run the program with the input file:



./recover card.raw  







Future Improvements



• Extend support for recovering other file types.

• Improve efficiency for large datasets.
