# Substitution Cipher  



## Description  

This project implements a substitution cipher in C++. It encrypts plaintext by substituting each letter with a corresponding character based on a user-provided key. The project demonstrates string manipulation, input validation, and basic cryptographic principles.  



## Features  

- Encrypts text using a custom substitution key.  

- Validates the substitution key for correctness (26 unique characters).  

- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.  



## Technologies Used  

- C++  



## How to Run  

1. Compile the code:  

   ```bash  

   g++ -o substitution substitution.cpp  



2. Run the program:



./substitution key  



Replace key with a 26-character substitution key.



Future Improvements



• Add decryption functionality.

• Support for non-English alphabets.
