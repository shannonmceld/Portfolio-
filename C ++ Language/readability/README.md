# Readability Checker  



## Description  

This project calculates the readability level of a given text using C++. It analyzes the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text and applies a formula (e.g., Coleman-Liau index) to determine the grade level required to understand the text.  



## Features  

- Accepts input text from the user.  

- Outputs a readability score as a grade level.  

- Demonstrates string parsing, loops, and arithmetic operations in C++.  



## Technologies Used  

- C++  



## How to Run  

1. Compile the code:  

   ```bash  

   g++ -o readability readability.cpp  



2. Run the program:



./readability  





3. Input the text to analyze when prompted.



Future Improvements



• Add support for analyzing larger files.

• Enhance the readability metrics to include more formulas.
