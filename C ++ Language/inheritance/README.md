# Inheritance in C++  



## Description  

This project demonstrates the use of inheritance in C++, a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming. It includes examples of parent-child class relationships, method overriding, and polymorphism.  



## Features  

- Implementation of base and derived classes.  

- Demonstrates the use of virtual functions for polymorphism.  

- Showcases constructors, destructors, and access specifiers in an inheritance hierarchy.  



## Technologies Used  

- C++  



## How to Run  

1. Compile the code:  

   ```bash  

   g++ -o inheritance inheritance.cpp  



2. Run the program:



./inheritance  







Future Improvements



• Add examples of multiple inheritance and interfaces.

• Extend functionality with real-world class hierarchies.
