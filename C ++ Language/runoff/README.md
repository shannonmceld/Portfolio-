# Runoff Voting System  



## Description  

This project implements a runoff voting system in C++. It allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference and determines the winner through an elimination process until a majority is achieved. The program demonstrates dynamic memory usage, arrays, and advanced logic handling.  



## Features  

- Supports ranked-choice voting.  

- Dynamically eliminates the candidate with the least votes in each round.  

- Outputs the winner or identifies ties.  



## Technologies Used  

- C++  



## How to Run  

1. Compile the code:  

   ```bash  

   g++ -o runoff runoff.cpp  



2. Run the program:



./runoff  





3. Input voter data as prompted.



Future Improvements



• Add error handling for invalid inputs.

• Extend support for larger datasets.
