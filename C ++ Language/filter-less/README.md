# Filter-Less Program  



## Description  

This project involves applying image processing filters to bitmap images using C++. It demonstrates the use of file I/O, manipulation of pixel data, and algorithm design to create filters like grayscale, sepia, and edge detection.  



## Features  

- Reads bitmap image files (BMP).  

- Applies multiple filters:  

  - Grayscale  

  - Sepia  

  - Edge detection  

- Outputs the processed image as a new BMP file.  



## Technologies Used  

- C++  

- Bitmap file manipulation  



## How to Run  

1. Compile the code:  

   ```bash  

   g++ -o filter-less filter-less.cpp  



2. Run the program with input and output file arguments:



./filter-less input.bmp output.bmp  







Future Improvements



• Add support for more filters (e.g., blur, sharpen).

• Enable compatibility with additional image formats.
