In the file called credit.c in the credit directory, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports 
whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, using Luhn’s algorithm, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows:

Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!
