# DNA Sequence Analyzer  

## Description  
This project is a Python-based DNA sequence analyzer. It compares a given DNA sequence against a database of known DNA profiles to identify a match. It demonstrates skills in file handling, string manipulation, and algorithmic problem-solving.  

## Features  
- Reads DNA profiles from a CSV file.  
- Scans a DNA sequence for short tandem repeats (STRs).  
- Matches STR counts to identify individuals from the database.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- CSV module for database handling  

## How to Run  
1. Install dependencies (if any):  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  

	2.	Run the program:

python dna.py database.csv sequence.txt  



Future Improvements

	•	Extend functionality to support additional DNA markers.
	•	Enhance error handling and input validation.
