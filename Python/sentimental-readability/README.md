# Sentimental Readability  

## Description  
This project combines sentiment analysis with readability scoring to evaluate text. It calculates the readability of a given text using algorithms like the Coleman-Liau index and layers sentiment analysis to provide insights into the emotional tone of the content. This showcases a blend of natural language processing (NLP) and Python scripting skills.  

## Features  
- Calculates readability scores for user-provided text.  
- Analyzes sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of the text.  
- Outputs combined readability and sentiment results.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Sentiment analysis libraries [re]

## How to Run  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash

	2.	Run the program:

python sentimental_readability.py  


	3.	Input a text sample when prompted to see readability and sentiment results.

Future Improvements
