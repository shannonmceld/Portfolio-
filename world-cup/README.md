# World Cup Simulation  

## Description  
This project simulates a World Cup tournament using Python. It demonstrates skills in probability, data structures, and simulation design. Teams compete in a series of matches, with winners determined based on predefined probabilities, culminating in a tournament champion.  

## Features  
- Simulates a full tournament with multiple teams.  
- Uses probabilities to determine match outcomes.  
- Outputs the winner and provides detailed match results.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python
- csv
- sys
- random
- time

## How to Run  
1. Run the program:  
   ```bash  
   python world_cup.py  

	2.	Input the number of teams and other parameters as prompted.
	3.	View the simulated results.

Future Improvements

	•	Add support for real-world team data.
	•	Enhance simulation with player stats and dynamic probabilities.
