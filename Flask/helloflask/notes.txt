Instead of putting HTML code right into our Python programs, it’s best to move our HTML into separate files, to keep separate concerns separate. Since our app will likely include a number of similar HTML files, we can create one layout.html file which all our HTML files “extend”. “Extending” an HTML file means to keep all of the content of that HTML file while also adding some custom content, specific to a particular page.

By convention, Flask puts all HTML files inside of a templates folder. Inside the helloflask folder, make a folder called templates using mkdir templates. All your HTML files will go in this templates folder.

Inside templates, create a layout.html file that looks like this:

<!-- The {% block body %}{% endblock %} syntax comes from Jinja, which is a “template engine” for Python.
The line with {% block body %}{% endblock %} is what makes this a layout file.
If another HTML file extends layout.html and defines a block called “body”, we’ll insert that block into this section of the layout.html.
A layout file can contain as many blocks as you want.
Just give each one a different name.-->
